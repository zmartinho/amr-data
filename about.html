        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            This website was inspired by the work of countless researchers gathering data on antimicrobial resistance throughout the world. 
            We seek to provide an interactive platform for exploring global data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to gather data and monitor the AMR status of different regions.
            Our platform allows users to view and compare data from different microorganisms across countries using both map visualizations and collected and processed data.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To monitor and provide udpates on AMR trends across different regions and microorganisms.</li>
            <li>To offer accessible and educational tools for public health professionals and students.</li>
            <li>To promote awareness of AMR as a global health concern.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The data used in this site is sourced from reputable global health organizations and research groups including the World Health Organization (WHO), 
            European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), and
            Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
            Each CSV file represents AMR statistics for a specific microorganism, broken down by countries with available data.
        </p>

        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
            This project was developed by researchers at Stanford University. The website was implemented by ZÃ© Martinho as part of an initiative to make epidemiological data more accessible.
